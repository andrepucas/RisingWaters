## __Movie Synopsis__

A poor artist and a young rich woman meet and fall in love while in the Titanic.
 Although she is married to a soon to be successful business owner, she defies
  her family and friends in search of the one true love.  

## __What We Want Out of The Movie__

In this project we are going to focus on the second part of the movie. We are
 going to focus on the part when the ship is sinking and we'll try to capture
 that moment in our game.

## __History__

You're **Arthur**, one of the few reporters who were lucky enough to get
 selected to be able to get on board of the Titanic on its inaugural trip. You
 were tasked to write an article about what's like to be on board of the
 world's fanciest ship.  
</br>
You get to your room and start to rest when suddenly you feel the ship shaking
 and you hear the alarms. You go gather your stuff and go out of the room to
 see what's going on when out of nowhere you see water flooding the hallway
 so you start to do the only thing you can think of...you run!

## __Mechanics__

### __Story Mode__

- __Jump__ -> [W], [Up Key] or [Space];
- __Duck__ -> [S], [Down Key] or [Control];
- __Pause__ -> [ESC];  
</br>
In this part of the game the player is running through the hallways in order to
 escape the water. He has to jump or duck to avoid the obstacles he faces
 otherwise he will slow down and get consumed by the wave of water behind him.
  
### __Arcade Mode__

- __Jump__ -> [W], [Up Key] or [Space];
- __Duck__ -> [S], [Down Key] or [Control];
- __Pause__ -> [ESC];  
</br>
The Arcade Mode will be similar to the story mode however, it won't end until
 the player dies.

## __Game Objectives__  

- __First Half__ -> Escape from the water while avoiding various obstacles;
- __Second Half__ -> Escape from the water while avoiding various obstacles for
 as long as you can;

## __Game "World"__

During the **story mode**  Arthur is running through hallways trying to escape
 the water that is flooding the ship. This ends when he reaches the opposite
 side of the ship.  

 During the **arcade mode** the same happens however Arthur never reaches his
 goal and runs forever.

## __Game Agents__

- __Arthur__ -> He is our main character and the player controls him.
  
- __Various types of debris__ -> These are all types of objects that can fall on
 the player and slow him down. For example, chairs, lamps...etc.
  
- __Obstacles__ -> Which the player has to jump over or duck under so he
 doesn't hit them and slow down.

- __The Water__ -> The player has to avoid getting overtaken by the water at all
 costs otherwise he will drown.
  
## __Types of Obstacles__

- __Table__ -> To pass this obstacle the player has to jump over.

- __Small Table__ -> To pass this object the player has to jump over the table.

- __Broken Lamp__ -> To pass this obstacle the player has to duck under this lamp.

## __Means of Storytelling__

In this game we will use cutscenes for when the player isn't controlling our
 main character. For example, when Arthur is going up floors, at the beginning
 of the game.

## __Art__

### __Cutscene__

For the initial cutscene we will have Arthur leave the room then the water
 rushes in through the hallway and he starts running.

### __Hallway__

This is the hallway that we are going to put on loop for the first part of the
 game. Has the player goes through he has to dodge various obstacles.
